# Map-Navigator-by-Dijkstra-Algo
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FOR DIJKSTRA ALGORITHUMN IN JAVA 
Explanation of the India Map Navigator Program


The `IndiaMapNavigator` program is designed to find the shortest path between two cities in India using Dijkstra's algorithm. The program represents a map of India as a graph, where cities are nodes, and the roads connecting them are edges with weights (distances).

Graph Representation
- Nodes- Each city is represented as a node.
- Edges-The connections (roads) between cities are represented as edges with associated weights, which are the distances between the cities.

 Core Components
1. Node Class- Represents each city.
   - Attributes- `name`: The name of the city.
     - `neighbors`: A map of neighboring cities and the distances to them.

2. IndiaMapNavigator Class- Manages the overall graph and provides methods to navigate between cities.
   - Attributes
     - `graph`: A map that stores all the cities and their connections.
   - **Methods**:
     - `createGraph()`: Initializes the graph by creating nodes for each city and establishing the connections between them.
     - `navigate(String start, String end)`: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the `start` and `end` cities.

Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The algorithm maintains a set of nodes whose shortest distance from the start node is known and iteratively updates the shortest distance to each neighbor until the shortest path to the destination is found.

Steps
1. Initialization- Start with the source node (`start` city), setting its distance to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.
   - Use a priority queue to explore the node with the smallest known distance.
   
2. Exploration- For the current node, check all its neighbors.
   - If a shorter path to a neighbor is found (through the current node), update the shortest distance to that neighbor and set the current node as the previous node on the path.
   
3. Completion- Continue until the destination node (`end` city) is reached or all nodes are explored.
   - Backtrack using the `previous` map to reconstruct the shortest path.

Example Use Case

Problem- Find the shortest path from Delhi to Bangalore.

Solution
1. Initialization- Set Delhi's distance to 0 and all other cities to infinity.
   - Place Delhi in the priority queue.

2. First Iteration- Delhi has the smallest distance (0). It is processed first.
   - Delhi's neighbors (Mumbai, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Lucknow) are examined.
   - Update the distances to these neighbors based on the direct distance from Delhi.
   - Add these neighbors to the priority queue.

3. Subsequent Iterations-The city with the smallest distance in the priority queue is processed.
   - Continue updating distances and adding new cities to the queue until Bangalore is reached.

4. Path Construction- Once Bangalore is reached, backtrack using the `previous` map to find the path from Delhi to Bangalore.

Output- The program will print the shortest path from Delhi to Bangalore, such as:
  
 [Path from Delhi to Bangalore: [Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore]
  

This output shows the route the algorithm determined to be the shortest, considering the distances between cities.

Application of the Program
- Navigation Systems- Similar principles are used in GPS systems to find the shortest or fastest route between two locations.
- Network Routing- In computer networks, Dijkstra's algorithm helps in finding the shortest path for data to travel across the network.
- Transport and Logistics- The algorithm can optimize routes for transportation and delivery services, minimizing travel time or distance. 

This example illustrates the practical application of graph theory and algorithms in solving real-world problems like finding optimal paths between locations.
